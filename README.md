# I'm Cody Ogden.

I'm Cody Ogden. I like to do internet things with internet people.

I've been crafting on the web since 2001, and it all started with a JavaScript program to help me cheat on math homework--fifth grade math is tough! I've held many hats in my career: individual contributor, technical lead, engineering manager, and company leadership. I've been lucky to work with companies like General Mills, Target, Best Buy, Rolex, and Charter Communications where I lead scalable, maintainable technology solutions that impact their business, people, and customers.

You might know me as the groundskeeper at the [Google graveyard](https://killedbygoogle.com) where I research Google's consumer product strategy and their 'killer' reputation.

My dog, Olly, and I live in San Francisco, California.
