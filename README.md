## I'm Cody Ogden. <br/>I'm a Technical Account Manager at [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

I've been crafting on the web since 2001, and it all started with a JavaScript program to help me cheat on math homework--fifth grade math is tough! I've worn many hats in my tech career: individual contributor, technical lead, engineering manager, and company leadership roles. I'm particularly interested in developer experience work, web optimization, and building, deploying, and optimizing large-scale Next.js applications with customers of all sizes.

I live in [Minneapolis, Minnesota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis) with my black goldendoodle, [Olly](https://www.instagram.com/ollyoxendoodle/).
