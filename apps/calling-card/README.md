A calling card is a small card bearing a person's name and address<br/>that is sent or left in lieu of a formal social or business visit.

### Inspiration

I love the idea of a small card that contains information about a person being left for someone to use to reach out to its creator. I wondered what a digital version of a calling card would look like for someone who builds projects and leaves them around the web like myself. I wanted it to be invitational to both learn more about me, find more of my projects, and provide a vector to announce new projects.

## Process

I [tested and prototyped the concept](https://codepen.io/codyogden/pen/jOONrWd) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io). From a technical perspective, I wanted to use no external libraries to keep the payload as minimal as possible. I then wanted to make it easy to adjust the content quickly, and allow it to be easy to alter the behavior in the future.

From an experience perspective, I wanted the calling card to be playful and inviting. To accomplish this, I added custom animation that made the experience smooth on desktop and mobile. The interface is driven by a button toggle, so accessibility was also kept in mind as well.

Finally, the design choices followed my living [style guide](https://style.codyogden.com). Featuring playful, rounded corners and colors I've been using for my personal branding for over multiple years. I wanted the design to be minimal but welcoming to all users.
